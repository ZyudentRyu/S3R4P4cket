# S3R4P4cket
This project automates network packet capture using tshark. The Python script allows configuration of start time, duration, repetitions, as well as the network interface and storage directory. Capture results are saved as .pcap files. Supports automatic repetition and creates the storage directory if it doesn't exist.
